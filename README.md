A flappy bird inspired clone game featuring the Illogical Bacon mascot

Flappy Pig is a side-view 2D autoscrolling Flappy Bird clone game.
It's sole existence was brought about by my desire to learn how to develop for Unity game engine
and this is my first project game.
It features custom music and sound effects, bonus coin pickups, and a Bacon power-up item that 
engages temporary invincibility for a few seconds.
